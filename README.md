# Mogi Table Bot
## Tutorial
## First Time Setup:
Download Mogi Table Bot.exe or Mogi Table Bot.exe NON EU depending on your Location. If you're planning to use the OBS Overlay, download the 2 Fonts aswell, and install them. 

Go to the Settings Tab and check the "Using OBS Virtual Camera" if you're using it for your own Gameplay, leave it disabled if you're watching a Stream. (Leaving it disabled will take a Screenshot from your PC, rather than your Capture Card).

Check the OBS Overlay Checkbox if you want to use the Overlay.

If you activated OBS Overlay this window should pop up.

This finished the Setup.

## How to Use:

Everytime you use the Bot you have to Start your Virtual Camera in OBS, so the Bot can get the Image from the Switch.

Whenever you're at the end of a race, wait until the Points finished adding up and press the Hotkey, you can alternatively wait until the Scoreboard sorts itself and press it then.

  Left = Good, Right = Bad
</p> 

In case of a Disconnect, enter the first Letter of the Tag, and the amount the Person disconnected with, (tells you in Overlay and next to Table). If more than one Person disconnected in a single race, you can check on the Screenshots Tab, to see how much each one disconnected with.

If the room crashes, press the Room Crash Button, and it will add the Points to the following Tables/Scores.
